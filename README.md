# Teltonika SDK toolchain

A build environment to build the Teltonika SDK toolchain.

The purpose of this project is not to aid in the development of your own version of the Teltonika RUT/TRB etc. firmware.
But to provide a toolchain for the compilation of software which you then can package as IPK packages.
